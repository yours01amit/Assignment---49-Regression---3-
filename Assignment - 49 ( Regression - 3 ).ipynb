    "- In Ridge Regression, a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients is added to the least squares objective function.\n",
    "- This penalty term is controlled by a tuning parameter called lambda (Î»).\n",
    "- The Ridge Regression objective function shrinks the coefficients towards zero, reducing the variance of the coefficient estimates and improving the stability of the model.\n",

    "- Here are some of the key assumptions of Ridge Regression:\n",
    "#\n",
    "1. Linearity\n",
    "    - It assumes that the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear. The model assumes that the change in the response variable due to a change in one predictor variable is constant and proportional.\n",
    "#\n",
    "2. Independence\n",
    "    - It assumes that the observations are independent of each other. This means that the value of one observation does not depend on the value of another observation in the dataset.\n",
    "#\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity\n",
    "    - It assumes that the variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the variance of the residuals is constant across the range of predicted values.\n",
    "#\n",
    "4. Normality\n",
    "    - It assumes that the errors are normally distributed with a mean of zero. This means that the distribution of residuals should be approximately symmetric around zero.\n",
    "#\n",
    "5. Multicollinearity\n",
    "    - It assumes that there is some degree of multicollinearity among the independent variables but not so high that it causes the model to become unstable.\n",
    "#\n",
    "- Violations of these assumptions can lead to inaccurate results and unreliable predictions.\n",
    "- It's also important to validate the assumptions of Ridge Regression using appropriate diagnostic tests to ensure that the model is appropriate for the data."

    "    - The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error or R-squared, and the value of lambda that yields the best performance on the validation set is chosen as optimal.\n",

    "    - A grid of possible values for lambda is specified and the model is fit with each value.\n",

    "#\n",
    "3. Analytical Methods\n",
    "    - Analytical methods can be utilized to select an appropriate value for lambda.\n",
    "    - For example, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) can be used to pick an optimal value by penalizing complexity in models making it a useful criterion for selection.\n",
    "#\n",

    "1. Standardize the data\n",
    "    - It is important to standardize the input variables in Ridge Regression to ensure that each variable is on the same scale.\n",
    "    - This is because Ridge Regression involves minimizing the sum of squared errors plus the penalty term, which is proportional to the L2 norm of the coefficients.\n",
    "    - If the variables are not on the same scale, then the penalty term will disproportionately affect variables with larger scales.\n",
